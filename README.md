# 🖼️ Photo Tagging App

**Photo Tagging App** is an interactive game-like application where users are presented with an image and must identify and tag 3 characters correctly. When a user clicks on a location in the image, a dropdown appears to choose one of the characters. Based on internal coordinate logic, the app notifies the user whether their selection is correct.
